I am a self-taught aspiring full-stack developer currently looking for the opportunity to change my career and make the jump into the software development industry.

## Core Skills

Front and back-end knowledge with experience in technologies such as React and NodeJS. Good understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Amicable and cooperative with a teamwork spirit. Passionate about technology and software development.

## Programming languages

- Ruby: my first programming language when I started learning to code.
- Python: have used it for data analysis, scripting, and Sublime Text plugin development.
- JavaScript and TypeScript: I am a big fan of statically typed languages, so I prefer to use TypeScript over JavaScript whenever I have the chance.
- C++: learned the basics of the language in a Coursera course about OOP (certificate [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/4QJM3K79ZS9D)).
- Go: basic knowledge and have used it lately going through one of [Udemy courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go/).
- Java: currently learning the basics while going through another [course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-java-programming-ii-object-oriented-programming) on OOP in Edx.
- Rust: went through [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to learn the basics of the language.
- Lua: use it to configure [Neovim](https://github.com/idr4n/nvim-lua) (my current text editor) and [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/idr4n/.dotfiles#hammerspoon-setup).

## Projects

These are some of my hobby projects as the result of my interest and going through coding tutorials:

- [BList](https://github.com/idr4n/blist): a React and Firebase web app to store and retrieve bookmarks using the keyboard. In early development.
- [Spacexapp](https://github.com/idr4n/spacexapp): simple React app using the SpaceX API.
- [Starwarsapi](https://github.com/idr4n/starwarsapi): a simple React app using the Star Wars API and Semantic UI.
- [Gatsby-bootcamp](https://github.com/idr4n/gatsby-bootcamp): A simple blog app using Gatsby.
- [OpenRecent](https://github.com/idr4n/OpenRecent): a Sublime Text plugin to open recent files and folders.
- [SublimeFind](https://github.com/idr4n/SublimeFind): a Sublime Text plugin that incorporates the output of `fd` and `rg` commands.
- [PathAutocomplete](https://github.com/idr4n/PathAutocomplete): a Sublime Text plugin for path auto-completion.
- [Email author identification](https://github.com/idr4n/naivebayes-email-author): training a Naive Bayes model to identify the author of an email or document using Python's `Sklearn` library.

## Technologies/frameworks

- React: I have been learning React for quite a while and it is the front-end framework I am most familiar with. I have used it in some of my projects.
- Other front-end frameworks: I have had some exposure (a.k.a played around with) Svelte and Vue.
- NodeJS: the back-end environment I am most familiar with. I have used it going through a couple of Udemy courses.
- Other back-end technologies: I am currently learning how to use Go for web development.

## Education

- PhD in Applied Economics (Western Michigan University).
- Bachelors in International Business and Economics (Universidad EAFIT).

## Work Experience

Since I graduated, I have worked in academia, which involves teaching and doing research. It has allowed me to develop strong analytical and interpersonal skills. I got interested in coding while writing statistics/econometrics programs in MatLab to run regressions and data analysis.
