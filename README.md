# About Me üòé 

Hi, my name is Ivan and I am a self-taught aspiring full-stack developer currently looking for the opportunity to change my career and make the jump into the software development industry.

## General Description

Front and back-end knowledge with experience in technologies such as React and NodeJS. Good understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Amicable and cooperative with a teamwork spirit. Passionate about technology and software development.

## Programming languages üíª

These are the programming languages I have worked with so far:

- Ruby: this was my first programming language when I started learning to code, although I don't use it anymore.
- Python: I am an Economist currently working in academia, and so I have used Python for data analysis. It was also my first programming language to learn about OOP, and I have currently used it to write some of my scripts (e.g., [add_image_shadow.py](https://github.com/idr4n/.dotfiles/blob/master/scripts), [change_dark_mode.py](https://github.com/idr4n/.dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/change_dark_mode.py)), and to develop a couple of Sublime Text plugins.
- JavaScript: a most for web development.
- TypeScript: I am a big fan of statically typed languages, so I prefer to use TypeScript over JavaScript whenever I have the chance.
- C++: learned the basics of the language in a Coursera course about OOP (certificate [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/4QJM3K79ZS9D)).
- Go: I am familiar with the basics of the language, and I have used it lately going through one of [Udemy courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go/).
- Java: I am currently using it while going through another course on OOP in [Edx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-java-programming-ii-object-oriented-programming) I am enrolled in.
- Rust: went through [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to learn the basics of the language.
- Lua: I use it to configure [Neovim](https://github.com/idr4n/nvim-lua) (my current text editor) and [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/idr4n/.dotfiles#hammerspoon-setup).

## Projects üìΩ

These are some of my hobby projects as the result of my interest and going through coding tutorials:

- [BList](https://github.com/idr4n/blist): a React and Firebase web app to store and retrieve bookmarks using the keyboard. In early development.
- [Spacexapp](https://github.com/idr4n/spacexapp): simple React app using the SpaceX API.
- [Starwarsapi](https://github.com/idr4n/starwarsapi): a simple React app using the Star Wars API and Semantic UI.
- [Gatsby-bootcamp](https://github.com/idr4n/gatsby-bootcamp): A simple blog app using Gatsby.
- [OpenRecent](https://github.com/idr4n/OpenRecent): a Sublime Text plugin to open recent files and folders.
- [SublimeFind](https://github.com/idr4n/SublimeFind): a Sublime Text plugin that incorporates the output of `fd` and `rg` commands.
- [PathAutocomplete](https://github.com/idr4n/PathAutocomplete): a Sublime Text plugin for path auto-completion.
- Training a Naive Bayes model to identify the author of an email or document using Python's `Sklearn` library ([here](https://github.com/idr4n/naivebayes-email-author)).

## Technologies/frameworks üí°

These are the frameworks or technologies I have worked with:

- React: I have been learning React for quite a while and it is the front-end framework I am most familiar with. I have used it in some of my projects.
- Other front-end frameworks: I have had some exposure (a.k.a played around with) Svelte and Vue.
- NodeJS: the back-end environment I am most familiar with. I have used it going through a couple of Udemy courses.
- Other back-end technologies: I am currently learning how to use Go for web development.

## Education üìö

- PhD in Applied Economics (Western Michigan University - Go Broncos üí™üèª).
- Bachelors in International Business and Economics (Universidad EAFIT).

## Work Experience üìà

Since I graduated, I have worked in academia, which involves teaching and doing research. It has allowed me to develop strong analytical and interpersonal skills. I got interested in coding while writing statistics/econometrics programs in MatLab to run regressions and data analysis.
